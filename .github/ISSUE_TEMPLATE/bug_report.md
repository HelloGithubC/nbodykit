**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Steps To Reproduce**
It helps us to diagnose the problem if you can describe the steps to reproduce the behaviour. 

**Actual behaviour**
What happens when you perform the steps to reproduce

**Expected behaviour**
What would you expected to happen. Can be as simple as 'this should work', if the expectation is obvious; but free free to elaborate if the situation is complicated.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to illustrate your problem.
For example, this can be a screenshot of the relevant sections of your notebook.

**Version**
Find the version of nbodykit by running
```
import nbodykit; print(nbodykit, nbodykit.__version__);
```
If you suspect the problem is related to a dependency (e.g. Corrfunc, pmesh, or mcfit), then it is useful to report the version of that dependency as well (replacing `nbodykit` with the package name).
